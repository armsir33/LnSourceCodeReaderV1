# Non GUI Infor LN Source Code Reader
As Infor developer, it is irrating to open many files at the same time when just check the specific implementation of APIs. The goal of the program is to ease Infor LN developer to read source code. 

The mechanism is simple. At first, users load all the fiels to be queried. Then, the program is to extract all APIs and corresponding implementation into database. The database is based on Apache Derby along with JPA/EclipseLink.

Since this version program is non GUI, an interactive shell is developered for users.
